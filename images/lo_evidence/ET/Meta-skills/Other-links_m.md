As team lead, I initiated and guided a discussion about designing reusable input systems. I listened to objections, adapted proposals based on team feedback, and reached a shared technical direction — supporting team cohesion and iterative improvement

I participated in a design dialogue where a teammate questioned our use of the Singleton pattern. I explained an alternative (Mediator) with practical examples, like managing resolution settings and player difficulty. I encouraged discussion and left space for team suggestions.

We used a retrospective board throughout our project to reflect on what went well, what went wrong, and what we could improve. I helped facilitate or contribute to these sessions by evaluating our teamwork, communication, and planning. It acted as an ongoing 360° feedback loop that influenced our workflow and role distribution.

I adapted team communication strategies based on feedback, shifting some meetings to async updates to accommodate availability. I also made sure team members who missed meetings received summaries or recordings, improving engagement and performance across the team.

We used our task board as a continuous performance tool. By reviewing movement across the board during retrospectives and meetings, we were able to assess sprint velocity, individual progress, and where bottlenecks occurred. I guided others on using the board to promote accountability.
The board itself is a tool for self and peer accountability. Reviewing board movement is a form of performance feedback.

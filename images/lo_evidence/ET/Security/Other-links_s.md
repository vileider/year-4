When a problem was introduced into the main development branch, I quickly patched it and provided steps to rebase existing branches. This action minimized disruption to the team and maintained development continuity, reflecting principles of business continuity planning and fault recovery in line with ISO/IEC 27031.

When multiple developers became unavailable — two due to disengagement and one due to personal issues — I stepped in to take over critical tasks and ensured the rest of the team was informed and aligned. This demonstrates my understanding of business continuity, including how to mitigate disruptions caused by team availability and preserve project momentum during staffing instability.

I recognized that our team’s existing Scrum workflow was no longer sustainable due to inconsistent attendance and communication breakdown. To reduce delivery disruption and preserve team momentum, I transitioned us to a Kanban model. This adjustment minimized dependencies, limited work-in-progress, and supported flexible task ownership — all aligned with business continuity principles.

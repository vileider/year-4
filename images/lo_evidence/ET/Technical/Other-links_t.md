I am showcasing understanding of code structure, testing practices, and language features (reflection in C#).
I am highlighting skills in maintaining or extending systems, especially if related to legacy or hard-to-test code.

Heavy on dev methodology (code efficiency, testing, version control, architecture).
Mentions unit testing, Unity tools, optimization, deployment—all tech-heavy topics.

We were exploring an input system where control can be passed between entities. I proposed splitting inputs into granular components (e.g., WASD) for flexible reuse. This design choice supports long-term maintainability and future features like multi-entity control or player switching.

We were deciding how to manage global game state (e.g., resolution, difficulty). I recommended using a Mediator pattern instead of relying on multiple Singleton instances. This helped reduce dependency chains and make components (e.g., camera, factory) more modular.

We introduced a rule to include Acceptance Criteria in every ticket, improving clarity of tasks and allowing us to verify when items are “done.” I also responded to queries about how to balance creative narrative content with gameplay-focused requirements.

I addressed an issue in the dev branch by releasing a quick patch. To ensure everyone was working from a clean base, I shared Git commands with the team for rebasing their branches. This demonstrates my ability to assess and correct issues in shared source code, and provide technical guidance to maintain workflow stability.

I reviewed a teammate’s pull request and identified issues with tuple declarations and dependency conflicts in Unity. After a teammate’s fix caused problems, I created a new branch from dev and resolved the issues. We also discussed IDE and tooling configurations to improve support for C#. This demonstrates my ability to identify and correct code quality issues, manage technical dependencies, and use appropriate tools for efficient debugging.

I designed and shared a UML class diagram showing the structure of our WorldLoader system, which includes MeshGenerator and ItemPlacer. I explained how the system loads and deserializes WorldData and uses that to generate in-game terrain and objects. I also iterated on the diagram based on peer feedback, correcting directional relationships. This demonstrates my ability to plan and communicate modular architecture and handle serialized data structures.

This Git branch overview demonstrates my structured use of source control during development. I created and maintained multiple branches linked to individual task IDs, each with its own pull request. This practice ensured that features and fixes were developed in isolation, then reviewed and merged cleanly. It reflects my ability to manage a scalable and maintainable codebase using best practices in version control.

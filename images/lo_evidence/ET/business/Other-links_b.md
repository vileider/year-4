I created this market research report to understand the financial potential and player demand for a farming-RPG tycoon game. I used secondary research (industry databases, competitor stats) and planned primary methods (surveys, social listening) to inform our product scope. This report directly supported early development decisions, including art style, feature prioritisation, and platform focus.

Report is an evidence for busines outcome because it focuses on:
- Industry analysis (market size, growth trends, competitive gaps)
- Target audience profiling
- Strategic product positioning
- Revenue forecasts
 -Product/market fit insights

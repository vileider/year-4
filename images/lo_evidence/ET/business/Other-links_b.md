I created this market research report to understand the financial potential and player demand for a farming-RPG tycoon game. I used secondary research (industry databases, competitor stats) and planned primary methods (surveys, social listening) to inform our product scope. This report directly supported early development decisions, including art style, feature prioritisation, and platform focus.

Report is an evidence for busines outcome because it focuses on:
- Industry analysis (market size, growth trends, competitive gaps)
- Target audience profiling
- Strategic product positioning
- Revenue forecasts
 -Product/market fit insights

In retrospectives, we often reviewed feedback from testers and stakeholders and used this to align with project goals and scope. For example, when we noted that a level felt too short or unclear, we adjusted pacing to better meet the player's experience expectations, adding value to our game.

When three developers became unavailable — two due to inactivity and one due to personal circumstances — I stepped in to take over their tasks and communicated the changes. This action helped prevent disruption to the sprint and reflects my understanding of business continuity planning, particularly in managing unplanned personnel loss and maintaining project delivery.

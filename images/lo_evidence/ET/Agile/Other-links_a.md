Contains timelines, project phases, and scope refinement practices.
Mentions flexibility and iterative development (“stay flexible,” phase-based plan, evolving aims).
Can back up Agile practices if I link it with sprints later.

In this exchange, I facilitated a discussion around input modularity for controlling entities in our game. We anticipated future gameplay mechanics requiring shared or transferred control (e.g., ship steering), and I proposed architectural solutions to avoid technical debt and maintain clean separation of concerns.

I led a technical discussion to address concerns about tight coupling caused by overuse of Singleton patterns. I suggested a Mediator design to manage shared state (e.g., game settings, player difficulty) more cleanly, reducing dependency issues and improving testability.

Our retrospectives served as a lightweight RAID log. Each session captured risks (missed deadlines, miscommunication), issues (technical blockers, short sprints), and possible mitigations. This helped us adapt our workflow and reprioritise tasks each week.

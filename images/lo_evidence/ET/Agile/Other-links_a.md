Contains timelines, project phases, and scope refinement practices.
Mentions flexibility and iterative development (“stay flexible,” phase-based plan, evolving aims).
Can back up Agile practices if I link it with sprints later.

In this exchange, I facilitated a discussion around input modularity for controlling entities in our game. We anticipated future gameplay mechanics requiring shared or transferred control (e.g., ship steering), and I proposed architectural solutions to avoid technical debt and maintain clean separation of concerns.

I led a technical discussion to address concerns about tight coupling caused by overuse of Singleton patterns. I suggested a Mediator design to manage shared state (e.g., game settings, player difficulty) more cleanly, reducing dependency issues and improving testability.

Our retrospectives served as a lightweight RAID log. Each session captured risks (missed deadlines, miscommunication), issues (technical blockers, short sprints), and possible mitigations. This helped us adapt our workflow and reprioritise tasks each week.

I organized and communicated our 2-week sprint schedule, including daily standups and biweekly planning/retros. We introduced async updates for better flexibility and ensured all backlog items had clear Acceptance Criteria. This helped reduce miscommunication and ensured clarity in deliverables.

I helped manage our Agile development board, where tasks were organized under Developing, Testing, and Done. I promoted shared accountability by encouraging teammates to assign tasks to themselves, ensuring progress stayed visible. This supported our sprint workflow by enabling asynchronous collaboration and reducing blockers. It demonstrates Agile planning and coordination, using a live tool to communicate task status and ownership across the team.

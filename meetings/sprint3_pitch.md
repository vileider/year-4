Good morning and afternoon,

I’ll start with a brief recap of what was accomplished during the last sprint update. Last Tuesday,
I discussed how the team has established foundational game components,
including a player object, lore, and streamlined development with TDD.
Our  focus was on implementing a procedurally generated world through a structured algorithm in three steps: 2D anchors,
island expansion, and 3D depth. I mentioned that responsibilities are divided among team members for coding standards,
algorithm development, and SCRUM practices, with main challenges involving module integration and catalog restructuring.

Today, I’ll discuss the goals set at the beginning of the sprint.
Three weeks ago, we focused on developing a map generator prototype, adding unit tests to all components,
and making our project TDD-driven. Sprint 2 tasks were completed before the deadline, so for Sprint 3,
we set more challenging goals to match the three-week timeline. I think we are close, although we encountered some challenges.
Recently, we needed a solution for creating a class to apply a mesh to our low-poly world.
Each obstacle we encountered was discussed in our project channel. From minor issues,
like questioning the naming convention for branch names (which, in retrospect, might warrant more attention),
to resolving merge conflicts by updating our local branches to prevent future issues,
to discussions about world size and related data.

All these issues were resolved in our designated project channels,
either in a specific room or a voice channel, allowing us to address each one precisely.
I believe we’ve been tackling problems like a professional team, and I hope we’ll complete all tickets
before this week’s planning session.

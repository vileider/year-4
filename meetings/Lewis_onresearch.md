## Quality Assurance (QA) Plan for Agile

Software Development Project
1. Introduction & Objectives
What to Include:
 Purpose of the QA plan.
I should write what is it. (50 -100 words)
A Quality Assurance (QA) plan's purpose is to ensure that the software developed adheres to high standards of quality, which means that it meets predefined criteria for functionality, performance, and user satisfaction. The QA plan acts as a roadmap guiding the team to consistently deliver a product that is reliable, efficient, and user-friendly. It outlines the necessary steps and strategies to test and verify that the software works as intended and is free of bugs or issues. By following a QA plan, potential problems can be identified and addressed early on, reducing risks and improving the overall development process. This is crucial in Agile projects where quick iterations and adaptability are key to success.

 Scope of quality assurance activities.
The scope of quality assurance activities includes:
- defining and agreeing on the requirements and deliverables of the project
- planning and implementing the necessary steps to ensure that the project is delivered on time, within budget and with the required quality
- monitoring and controlling the project's progress to ensure that it is on track and that any deviations from the plan are identified and addressed early on
- reporting on the project's progress and performance to stakeholders
- identifying and addressing any potential risks and issues that may impact the project's success
- documenting lessons learned and best practices for future projects

 Key quality goals and alignment with Agile principles.
The key quality goals of the project are:
- to deliver a product that meets the agreed-upon requirements and is of high quality
- to ensure that the project is delivered on time and within budget
- to ensure that the project is delivered with the required level of quality and that any defects or issues are identified and addressed early on
- to ensure that the project is delivered with the required level of security and compliance
- to ensure that the project is delivered with the required level of performance and scalability
- to ensure that the project is delivered with the required level of usability and user experience
- to ensure that the project is delivered with the required level of maintainability and supportability
- to ensure that the project is delivered with the required level of documentation and training

2. QA Roles & Responsibilities
What to Include:
 Description of team roles in the QA process.
The team roles in the QA process are:
- Developers: responsible for developing the code and implementing the necessary tests
- QA Engineers: responsible for developing and executing the necessary tests
- Scrum Master: responsible for ensuring that the team follows the Agile principles and practices
- Product Owner: responsible for defining and agreeing on the requirements and deliverables of the project
- DevOps/Release Manager: responsible for planning, implementing and monitoring the necessary steps to ensure that the project is delivered on time, within budget and with the required quality

3. Quality Standards & Best Practices
What to Include:
 Coding standards and best practices.
The coding standards and best practices to be followed are:
- to write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- to ensure that the code is of high quality and that any defects or issues are identified and addressed early on
- to ensure that the code is secure and compliant with the required standards
- to ensure that the code is performance and scalable
- to ensure that the code is maintainable and supportable
- to ensure that the code is documented and tested

4. Agile Testing Approach
What to Include:
 Explanation of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD).
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetitive cycle of writing automated tests before writing the actual code. The process starts with writing a test, then writing the code to pass the test, and finally refactoring the code to make it maintainable and efficient. TDD is a key part of Agile development and is used to ensure that the code is of high quality and that any defects or issues are identified and addressed early on.

5. Test Strategy
What to Include:
 Overview of automated and manual testing approaches.
The test strategy is to use a combination of automated and manual testing approaches. The automated testing approach will be used to test the code at the unit level, while the manual testing approach will be used to test the code at the integration and system levels. The automated testing approach will be used to test the code quickly and efficiently, while the manual testing approach will be used to test the code thoroughly and to ensure that it is of high quality.

6. Continuous Integration & Deployment (CI/CD)
What to Include:
 Role of version control (Git, GitHub, GitLab).
The role of version control is to manage the code and ensure that all changes are tracked and documented. Version control will be used to manage the code and ensure that all changes are tracked and documented. Version control will also be used to automate the testing and deployment of the code.

7. Defect Management & Tracking
What to Include:
 Tools for defect tracking (Jira, Azure DevOps, Trello).
The tools to be used for defect tracking are Jira, Azure DevOps, and Trello. These tools will be used to track and manage defects and issues, and to ensure that they are identified and addressed early on.

8. Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done (DoD)
What to Include:
 Guidelines for defining acceptance criteria for user stories.
The guidelines for defining acceptance criteria for user stories are:
- the acceptance criteria should be clear and concise
- the acceptance criteria should be measurable and verifiable
- the acceptance criteria should be relevant and meaningful
- the acceptance criteria should be realistic and achievable
- the acceptance criteria should be agreed upon by all stakeholders
- the acceptance criteria should be documented and tracked

9. Risk Management & Mitigation
What to Include:
 Identification of potential risks (security, performance, compliance).
The potential risks to be identified and addressed are:
- security risks
- performance risks
- compliance risks
- risks related to the project's scope, schedule, and budget
- risks related to the project's stakeholders and resources
- risks related to the project's technology and infrastructure

10. Continuous Improvement & Feedback Loops
What to Include:
 Importance of sprint retrospectives.s
The importance of sprint retrospectives is that they provide an opportunity for the team to reflect on the project's progress and identify areas for improvement. Sprint retrospectives are an important part of Agile development and are used to ensure that the project is delivered on time, within budget and with the required quality. Sprint retrospectives are also used to identify and address any potential risks and issues that may impact the project's success.

## poisson disk sampling nad perlin noise
- it is tailored for bitmaps, generating random positions for the seeds, creating a number of flags, and generating a 2D array of points (possible positions of trees)
- Perlin noise allows us to generate areas where points are distributed in a way we want, and then Perlin noise decides which tree has to be spawned
- higher density threshold generates fewer trees on the map
- once there is a flag in space, we spawn the items

## simplex noise:
- it generates noise by combining values from multiple input points.

## voronoi algorithm:
- starts from seeds and divides the space by colour-biased areas. We could have the same type of tree useful in bioams.

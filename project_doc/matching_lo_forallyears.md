You can absolutely match all learning outcomes from our project, and it's about finding the right task or feature to align with each one. Let's walk through how each of your project tasks can match the learning outcomes more comprehensively, ensuring that every LO is covered.

Agile Learning Outcomes (LO1.1.1.1, LO1.1.2.1, LO1.1.3.1)
LO1.1.1.1 - Delivering Value Early and Often:

Features like player movement and inventory are fundamental, providing immediate player engagement. Prioritize these early on for quick value delivery, while iterating on features like AI for NPCs and combat systems as the project matures.
Example: Reflect on how creating the movement component first allowed the team to test gameplay early.
LO1.1.2.1 - Manage Deviations from Schedule:

If you face delays with tasks like the procedural map generator, reflect on how you identified and managed these deviations (perhaps by reassigning resources or adjusting the timeline).
Example: Show an adjusted Kanban board reflecting these changes.
LO1.1.3.1 - Regular Project Reviews:

Incorporate regular reviews for tasks such as the combat system or skill tree, ensuring that features meet expectations and iterating based on feedback.
Example: Record review meetings and discuss how feedback impacted the next steps.
Business Learning Outcomes (LO1.1.1.2, LO1.1.2.2, LO1.1.3.2)
LO1.1.1.2 - Timeliness and Focus:

Reflect on how you balanced the completion of tasks (like creating the interaction handler) with external distractions or additional coursework.
Example: Develop a daily schedule and reflect on how you adhered to it, especially during tight deadlines.
LO1.1.2.2 - Industry Software Development Process:

For tasks like creating world generator or trading system, explain how the Agile process is aligned with industry practices (e.g., using scrum or sprints).
Example: A reflection comparing your Agile process with industry practices shared by a guest speaker or article.
LO1.1.3.2 - Threat Models:

Design a security threat model when developing the taming or farming systems, identifying potential threats to in-game economies or player data.
Example: Document a threat analysis showing how resource theft in the economy could impact gameplay and security.
Employability Learning Outcomes (LO1.1.1.3, LO1.1.2.3, LO1.1.3.3)
LO1.1.1.3 - Team Communication:

Showcase team collaboration during the Lore design thinking session and discuss how you handled feedback and task delegation for feature implementations like the inventory or combat items.
Example: Peer feedback after a code review session, reflecting on communication and how disagreements were resolved.
LO1.1.2.3 - Giving and Receiving Feedback:

Use code reviews for components like the singleton class or world generator, demonstrating how you applied feedback to improve your implementation.
Example: A reflection on how peer reviews helped refine your code, along with a summary of feedback given.
LO1.1.3.3 - Stakeholder Communication:

When presenting features like the skill tree to the team or external stakeholders, assess your audience and adjust your presentation methods.
Example: Record yourself presenting a feature to peers and reflect on how you adapted based on the feedback received.
Security Learning Outcomes (LO1.1.1.4, LO1.1.2.4, LO1.1.3.4)
LO1.1.1.4 - Understanding Cyber Security:

Consider the login systems and inventory management when addressing cyber security, reflecting on potential attacks and mitigations.
Example: A screencast explaining how secure login systems or encryption could mitigate risks.
LO1.1.2.4 - Importance of Cyber Security:

For features like trading systems, emphasize the importance of securing transactions between players and NPCs, and how breaches could affect gameplay.
Example: Reflections on past game breaches and how similar vulnerabilities are being avoided in your project.
LO1.1.3.4 - Code Analysis Frameworks:

Utilize tools like SonarQube or Checkstyle to ensure your world generator or combat system meets security standards, running static and dynamic code analyses.
Example: A generated report showcasing the results of your static and dynamic code analysis.
Technical Learning Outcomes (LO1.1.1.5, LO1.1.2.5, LO1.1.3.5)
LO1.1.1.5 - Common Programming Techniques:

Write tests for the movement component and camera control, showcasing common control flow techniques like if-else or loops.
Example: Unit test code showing how different components (like inventory) interact, with clear reflections on the tests' effectiveness.
LO1.1.2.5 - Algorithm Performance:

Compare performance of algorithms used in the procedural map generator, focusing on memory vs. performance tradeoffs for handling large maps.
Example: Code comparisons and reflections on why one algorithm was faster or more memory-efficient than another.
LO1.1.3.5 - Coding Patterns and Debugging:

Implement and debug the mediator design pattern for the combat system, explaining why you used it and reflecting on how it improved the overall structure.
Example: Code samples and reflections on how the mediator pattern made debugging easier or improved performance.
Continuous Development Learning Outcomes (LO1.2.1.1, LO1.2.1.2, LO1.2.1.3)
LO1.2.1.1 - Software Development Lifecycles:

Reflect on your projectâ€™s development lifecycle (e.g., Kanban or Scrum) and how it structured your approach to tasks like the driving mechanic or sailing mechanic.
Example: Reflection on how Kanban helped prioritize work and adapt to unexpected issues.
LO1.2.1.2 - Information as an Asset:

For the market simulation or demand-supply system, reflect on how valuable game data (e.g., player transactions) should be protected and valued.
Example: A written analysis of how information in your system is treated as an asset and how security measures were applied.
LO1.2.1.3 - Personal Development Plan:

Create a personal development plan detailing how tasks like the farming system or weather system will help you develop key technical skills.
Example: Submit a completed development plan and end-of-semester reflection on your progress.
Creativity through Patterns, Databases, Data Languages, Insight from Data, etc.
LO1.3.1.5 - Databases: For inventory and trading systems, create relational databases ensuring referential integrity.

Example: SQL code for the database and a reflection on the integrity constraints used.
LO3.9.1.1 - Risk Analysis (Insight from Data): For the AI enemy combat system, assess risks in implementing combat logic that could break or give unfair advantages to players.

Example: Document a risk log detailing potential issues during development.
LO3.8.1.5 - Configuration Management (Software Release Management): Use Docker or Kubernetes for version control and continuous integration, ensuring smooth deployment of the game engine across development, testing, and production environments.

Example: Docker for CICD promoting website.

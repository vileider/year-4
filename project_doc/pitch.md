The world of "Scattered Islands" is designed as an archipelago. Players will explore islands, encountering various races like dwarves, elves, and, of course, humans. Each time a player starts a new game, a new world will be procedurally generated.

In the game, farming will be centered around a system where crops grow differently depending on the soil. Players will need to understand how certain crops perform better in specific soil types and carefully manage the land by rotating crops and using fertilizers to get the best results. It’s not just about planting but also ensuring the long-term health of the soil.

Players will also manage different types of livestock, each offering special benefits like milk, wool, or eggs. Having a variety of animals on the farm will provide players with more resources to use or sell, contributing to the farm’s success.

In addition to traditional farming, machines will be available to automate productivity, offering a futuristic twist to farming and increasing efficiency.

On the economic side, the market will react to supply and demand. Prices at town markets will fluctuate based on the availability of products. NPCs in the game will have their own AI, buying and selling goods just like the player, which will influence market prices. Players will compete with NPCs to make the most profit. Every market will be trade-driven, so players will need to monitor prices and outsmart others to secure the best deals.

We hope to build a big fan base that would help improving game quality with their feedback.

1. Target Platform:
   - Primary: PC (Windows, macOS, Linux)
   - Potential future expansion: Mobile (iOS, Android)

2. Art Style and Visual Design
   - Overall Aesthetic
   - Low poly 
   - Realistic
   - 3D
   - isometric camera

3. Gameplay Focus
    - Farming simulator
    - RPG
    - Tycoon
    - action
    - Responsive World
    - Demanding combat system
    - Sailing

4. Character Design
    - Human
    - Early adulthood/late teens

5. Environmental design
    - Archipelago; many islands of varying size and type separated by water
    - Different races populate different islands and/or parts of the world
    - Different levels of development across different races;
    (e.g. dwarves will have mastered hydraulics and electricity while another race may be a lot less developed)
    - Deterministic weather system with realistic parameters (e.g. humidity & temperature)


6. Audio Focus
    - Multiple audio states for different activities 
    (e.g. a track for when the player is working, and a track for when the player is sailing)
    - Seamless transitions between different audio states
    - Audio style must fit with the graphical design
    - No voice acting

7. Quest and Mission Structure:
   - Main Storyline dictated by the lore
   - Side quests given by NPC's

8. Gameplay Mechanics (more detailed):
   - Real-time combat system
   - Simulated economy and economy based trade
   - Skill trees
   - Fertility and acidity reliant farming system
   - No magic. Only melee and ranged weapons
    
9. Minimum System Requirements (PC):
   - Operating System: Windows 7 SP1+ or macOS 10.12+
   - CPU: Intel Core i3-3210 or AMD A8-7600 APU
   - RAM: 4 GB
   - GPU: DX10, DX11, or DX12 capable GPU with 1 GB VRAM
   - Storage: 20 GB available space
   - Note: These are initial estimates and may be adjusted based on development progress

10. Multiplayer Capabilities:
   - Version 1.0: Single-player only
   - Multiplayer features may be considered for future updates or sequels

11. Development Focus:
   - Code Efficiency: Implement optimization techniques to ensure smooth performance on lower-end systems
   - Code Maintainability: Implement well thought of design patterns for maximum code readability, scalability, and maintainability
   - Graphics Optimization: Utilize a graphic style that balances visual appeal with performance
   - Asset Management: Implement efficient asset loading and unloading to minimize RAM usage

12. Version Control:
   - Git for source control
   - Unity Collaborate for asset management

13. Build and Deployment:
   - Use Unity's built-in build system for creating distributable game packages
   - Implement auto-update system for post-launch patches

14. Third-party Tools and Plugins:
   - (List any specific Unity Asset Store tools or third-party plugins you plan to use)

15. Performance Targets:
   - Frame Rate: 60 FPS on recommended systems, 30 FPS minimum on lower-end systems
   - Loading Times: Maximum of 30 seconds for initial game load, 5 seconds for area transitions

16. Scalability:
    - Implement graphics quality settings (Low, Medium, High) to accommodate various system capabilities
    - Design systems with mobile porting in mind for future development

17. Data Management:
    - Local save system with cloud save integration (e.g., Steam Cloud for PC version)
    - Efficient data serialization for save files
    - Database for runtime information

18. Testing Environment:
    - Develop on mid-range development machines to ensure optimization for average consumer hardware
    - Unity Test Framework
    - Unit testing
    - Establish a range of test machines representing minimum, recommended, and high-end specs

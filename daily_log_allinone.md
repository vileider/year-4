The main goal of creating a lot of epics and initiatives is to be prepared for any number of people joining the project.

Some team members did not appear, so I used a framework with FACTS,
REACTION, CONSEQUENCES, EXPECTATIONS to prevent people from being late in the future.
I kept thinking about how to upgrade CinemaMachine - one of Unity's packages.
I was struggling to make sure the camera was looking at the player in the way I intended.
I was wondering whether the camera should follow the player, and whether pressing the bottom key,
like "S" or the down arrow, should always move the player towards the bottom of the screen or
if the player should move freely. I learned that the camera is somehow connected to the player's
movement in games. The way the camera moves adds character to the game,
so I need to approach this task carefully.

Today, I was gathering documents and filling out all the forms that were expected

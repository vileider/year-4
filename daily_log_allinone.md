After a daily with the Scattered Lands Team, I entered into another meeting with my friend, a senior manager. We discussed an interesting idea about a smart home meter. We agreed to meet the next day and, after confirming the need and purpose of the product, followed by market research. We will create a project specification. 
Before the planning, we will create a Code of Conduct. 
### 30.09.2024
After the daily meeting, I managed to create a separate component that will take care of animation.
### 1.10.2024
During the project pitch meeting, I learned that it would be important to create tasks that could be taken while working under the project.
Charles suggested that we should have a plan for the next couple of months and at least some vision of what we can take care of from sprint to sprint. The team can suggest what was written in the plan, but can work flexibly and pick tasks that are suitable at the moment. The main goal of creating a lot of epics and initiatives is to be prepared for any number of people joining the project.
Sergio said that even if I do not know the answer to a question during the presentation, I should answer with a willingness to reach back to the person asking once I get the answer in a short period of time.
### 2.10.2024

I will use that package because it simplifies player tracking. It allows adding various cinematic effects in the future.
### 8.10.2024
I managed to create a component that will add Cinemabench camera to any entity.
I attend to the guest lecture and made some notes about it.
### 9.10.2024
I had a daily stand-up with the team.
Some team members did not appear, so I used a framework with FACTS,
REACTION, CONSEQUENCES, EXPECTATIONS to prevent people from being late in the future.
I kept thinking about how to upgrade CinemaMachine - one of Unity's packages.
I was struggling to make sure the camera was looking at the player in the way I intended.
I was wondering whether the camera should follow the player, and whether pressing the bottom key,
like "S" or the down arrow, should always move the player towards the bottom of the screen or
if the player should move freely. I learned that the camera is somehow connected to the player's
movement in games. The way the camera moves adds character to the game,
so I need to approach this task carefully.
### 10.10.2024
Today, I was gathering documents and filling out all the forms that were expected
to get the Computing Technician internship position. I also informed the team that due to high velocity,
we should create more tasks at the next sprint. Also, I am thinking if we should not organize
the planning meeting earlier because we finished all the tasks before the deadline.
I took part in an LO session and students have been informed we should focus on creating
interesting software instead of writing reflections about it.

My question is, If I am aiming in to innowation and  something that gonn be viral, some:
- I need to look for a focus group
- user and tasks analyzis
- EXPECTATIONS
- a task in a game
- a new innvoate camera and look for feedback
- do the same with standard camera and look for feedback.
### 26.10.2024 - 6.11.2024

He explained that some desiging solution are better than others.
### 26.11.2024
Tuesday was quite disastrous, starting from the sprint review,
where I wasn't prepared enough and my performance during the meeting wasn't clear to the audience. 
Later, I discovered that in the middle of the sprint, my team deleted some part of the design
and erased tickets on the scrum board and created new ones. 
I had a long conversation with Gracja that it was not the right way of doing it.
### 27.11.2024
Wednesday I was at work but I attended the daily meeting and recorded a message to the team, 
highlighting the need for professionalism, attendance, accountability, and communication. 
I explained to them that without these, running a team does not make sense to me, 
and I prepared a code of conduct which should have been done at the beginning of the project. 
However, I don't think it would have resonated as well if it had been created then, as now all project participants must sign it at once.
### 28.11.2024
Thursday I started designing UI from the beginning with Gracjan. 
We changed the pattern into a more game dev fitting one - creational prototype. 
During the day we learned how to implement the new UI framework, #
and at night time we finished emergency planning and populated the scrum board with ACs.
### 29.11.2024

### 2.12.2024
after daily I was struggling to create scene conroler so I  asked gracja if he can help me.
During the voice call he explained that there is already a scene switcher nested in the code that block my code form 
doing the same thing. Afternoon I prepared a script for next day sprint review session.

I also posted a message in the General channel to all participants, suggesting that we should have two teams and work
in pair programming from now on to finish the small demo before the competition’s due date.
We started another ticket that involves creating the menu and settings as outlined in the Figma design.
### 28.12.2025 - 29.12.2025
work at UHI
### 30.12.2025
Today, I was updating the UI to match the Figma design.
Later, I caught up with Gracjan and started pair programming so he could help me understand custom components, prefabs, and custom scripts.
After that, we had a sprint review meeting, during which Charles
taught me that we should implement a UI wireframe design to help other project participants understand how the UI will function.
I used Figma for most of my tasks and discovered that it also allows us to create UI wireframe designs for existing projects.
### 07.02.2025
At the beginning of the day, I was focused on the UI, experimenting with scripts and prefabs to find the most efficient way to build it. I got stuck for a bit while trying to create an outline around an image. Later, I had a 4th-year LO session, and after that, I had a meeting with Marta where we discussed different advanced algorithms and how our team is using them. We also talked about debugging the world generator because, on Marta’s computer, the world was taking a very long time to generate. I proposed using a selective debug log method to address the issue.
### 10.02.2025
Today, I focused on enhancing the Unity project by deepening my understanding of the Unity UI system.
I successfully integrated prefabs and scripts, which allowed me to create a fully resizable main menu adaptable to any resolution.
Additionally, I implemented a feature to modify the title and button fonts through a single script—this approach will also be used for future language changes.
I also had a productive pair programming session with Gracja, during which we established foundational principles for treating items as entities with components.
Due to work commitments over the next two days, I plan to address further tasks after work in preparation for Thursday's sprint review.
### 13.02.2025
I was working on the UI and almost finished my task. I had to do some research on how to attach scripts to buttons. At one point, I accidentally deleted the EventSystem, which caused the actions to stop working properly.
In the afternoon, I attended the sprint review, where I learned about a new concept called parallel programming. This approach utilizes multiple cores to handle different tasks simultaneously.
### 17.02.2025
- working under new game button

It was very long and exhausting, but we managed to create a definition of done and estimate the
game demo for 6 weeks (3 sprints).
### 25.02.2025
Today, I finished a business competition question form online, and I also added a localization system to unity game.

### 7.03.2025
I had an LO session and started a new ticket.
### 10.03.2025
I was working on Unity prefabs and coded entities. I came to the conclusion that we should use Unity's tools to simplify everything.
Gracjan and I figured out that the ground needs to be more of a physical object to allow other objects to collide with it.
### 11.03.2025
I was improving the inventory UI with Gracjan, and we discussed how it should be implemented.
### 13.03.2025
I checked PR and I fixed and moved my tasks to done. I prepared a presentation for the sprint review.
### 24.03.2025
I picked up a ticket to trigger the trader window once the player enters the trader's radius in the game HUD. However, when I started creating the collision sphere, the player began walking on the sphere instead of walking into it.
I believe this happened because the current player script handles collisions differently from other world objects. So, I decided to also take the player refinement ticket.
### 25.03.2025
I focused on preparing for the business competition
### 26.03.03 - 28

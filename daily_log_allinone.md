During the project pitch meeting, I learned that it would be important to create tasks that could be taken while working under the project.
Charles suggested that we should have a plan for the next couple of months and at least some vision of what we can take care of from sprint to sprint. The team can suggest what was written in the plan, but can work flexibly and pick tasks that are suitable at the moment. The main goal of creating a lot of epics and initiatives is to be prepared for any number of people joining the project.

I attend to the guest lecture and made some notes about it.
### 9.10.2024
I had a daily stand-up with the team.
Some team members did not appear, so I used a framework with FACTS,
REACTION, CONSEQUENCES, EXPECTATIONS to prevent people from being late in the future.
I kept thinking about how to upgrade CinemaMachine - one of Unity's packages.
I was struggling to make sure the camera was looking at the player in the way I intended.
I was wondering whether the camera should follow the player, and whether pressing the bottom key,
like "S" or the down arrow, should always move the player towards the bottom of the screen or
if the player should move freely. I learned that the camera is somehow connected to the player's
movement in games. The way the camera moves adds character to the game,
so I need to approach this task carefully.
### 10.10.2024
Today, I was gathering documents and filling out all the forms that were expected
to get the Computing Technician internship position. I also informed the team that due to high velocity,
we should create more tasks at the next sprint. Also, I am thinking if we should not organize
the planning meeting earlier because we finished all the tasks before the deadline.

interesting software instead of writing reflections about it.

- I need to look for a focus group
- user and tasks analyzis
- EXPECTATIONS
- a task in a game
- a new innvoate camera and look for feedback
- do the same with standard camera and look for feedback.

and erased tickets on the scrum board and created new ones.

### 27.11.2024
Wednesday I was at work but I attended the daily meeting and recorded a message to the team, 
highlighting the need for professionalism, attendance, accountability, and communication. 
I explained to them that without these, running a team does not make sense to me, 
and I prepared a code of conduct which should have been done at the beginning of the project. 
However, I don't think it would have resonated as well if it had been created then, as now all project participants must sign it at once.
### 28.11.2024

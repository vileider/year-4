Enterprise transformation
Assess existing legacy software, and review the source code if available, appreciating that part or all of the system may be implemented using an obsolete programming language.
Take a look in the https://archive.org/details/software.
Other things you can do is the master the mainframe - think COBOL, REXX - is there such a thing as an obsolete programming language?
What does actually mean do you think?
Make sure you provide justification through academic literature that looks at historic trends in languages and also think about the impact of legacy software in terms of security, usability, accessibility etc.

In the software development is evloving, I am 37 years old and I observed the lifecycle of some programming languages. I never work with COBOL and FORTRAN but I knew once they were pillars in business and scientific computing. Now are mostly used in old, outdated systems. The Turbo Pascal that used to be my first programming language, it played a significant role in computer science education. Now Python and Java are more popular. Even Objective-C, which was used for making iPhone apps not long ago, has been quickly replaced by Swift. It's important for professionals to keep track of new developments and regularly update their skills. Staying informed about the latest technological trends helps ensure one remains effective and valuable in this fast-changing field. New languages that work better, have more features, and are easier to use will always replace older ones. Looking at this trend, we can see that being able to adapt and learn new technologies is really important for developers today.

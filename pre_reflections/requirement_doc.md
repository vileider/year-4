MVP - Software challenge
Create a requirements document that agrees, with respect to all stakeholders involved, the purpose of the project.
Identify who your stakeholders are. If the stakeholder is only you then its not going to fulfil the requirements for this learning outcome.  You need to use the interview skills from year 3 to create evidence to generate a requirements document - this could be a backlog and initial set of sprint items.  You need to be clear about the purpose of the product and what you hope to achieve during the build - i.e. what is in the minimal viable product.  You need to be realistic and try and get through one complete cycle to a release as early as possible.  You can then iterate.  Remember the sooner you can get feedback and pivot the better the outcome.  If you spend 12 weeks development time and still not released anything either through the web, an app store, side-loading or desktop installation, you may struggle.

If you are in work, you should consult with your line manager and discuss ideas with them that they would be happy for you to work for a small proportion of your time.  This could adding a new feature to their existing software or generate a blue skies concept for them.  If you have difficulty with this consult with the delivery staff.  As long as the project is agreed with the staff it is considered valid.

At my internship, I’ve been working with Proxmox, setting up a server and configuring it into a clustered environment. This experience directly ties into two key concepts in modern IT: virtualization and clustering. Virtualization allows one physical machine to run multiple isolated virtual machines, each with its own OS and workloads. Clustering, on the other hand, connects multiple nodes to work as one system, providing redundancy, high availability, and scalability. Using Proxmox, I’ve been applying these technologies to build a more efficient and resilient IT infrastructure.

In today's IT landscape, the demand for centralized management, redundancy, and scalable infrastructure is rapidly growing. At my internship, I’ve experienced this firsthand by working on a Proxmox VE cluster, where I use both the web interface and CLI tools to manage and configure nodes efficiently—providing a unified and streamlined approach to infrastructure control. I also configured High Availability (HA), ensuring that in case of a node failure, virtual machines automatically migrate to another node within a minute, minimizing downtime and maintaining service continuity. For scalability, I'm currently developing a PXE boot solution to automate OS installations on new desktop machines, which will significantly speed up deployment and resource scaling. These tasks not only reflect modern IT priorities but also show how practical solutions can make infrastructure more resilient, efficient, and adaptable.

In my internship, I've been working with Proxmox VE, an open-source virtualization platform that integrates KVM for full virtualization and LXC for containers. It offers a web-based interface for managing virtual machines, containers, storage, and networks, facilitating centralized management of IT resources .
I've configured a Proxmox cluster by connecting multiple nodes, enabling features like high availability and resource sharing. This setup ensures that if one node fails, workloads can be automatically migrated to another, minimizing downtime .
Additionally, I'm implementing PXE booting, which allows computers to boot and install operating systems over a network without the need for physical media. This approach streamlines the deployment of operating systems across multiple machines, enhancing scalability and reducing manual intervention .

I installed Proxmox VE by first creating a bootable USB from the ISO and then booting the server to launch the graphical installer. The setup process involved selecting the target disk, configuring the network with a static IP, and setting the root password. After installation, I accessed the Proxmox web interface via the server's IP address on port 8006, allowing me to manage virtual machines and containers. I also utilized the command-line interface on each node for quicker configurations when necessary

I set up a Proxmox cluster where multiple nodes communicate over a private network to synchronize configurations and monitor each other's status. This setup enables high availability; if one node fails, its virtual machines automatically migrate to another node, ensuring minimal downtime. To facilitate this, I configured shared storage using NFS, allowing all nodes to access the same disk images and data. This shared storage is crucial for seamless VM migration and consistent data access across the cluster.

I've been setting up PXE to automate OS deployments across multiple desktops, streamlining the provisioning process. The setup involves configuring a DHCP server to assign IP addresses and direct clients to a TFTP server, which provides the necessary boot files and OS images. This approach enables centralized management of OS installations, ensuring consistency and reducing manual intervention. By implementing PXE booting, we've achieved faster, more efficient deployments, which is especially beneficial in environments requiring rapid scaling or frequent system refreshes.

I applied my foundational knowledge in networking and Linux system administration to real-world tasks involving virtualization and automation. I set up and managed a Proxmox VE cluster, which strengthened my understanding of distributed systems, particularly in how nodes communicate and maintain high availability using shared storage like NFS. Through daily use of the Proxmox web interface and command line, I developed stronger Bash scripting and system configuration skills, especially in areas like static IP setup, user permissions, and service monitoring. Working on PXE boot integration taught me how automated provisioning works at the network level, deepening my grasp of DHCP/TFTP services, PXE protocol flow, and efficient OS deployment strategies. 

My work with Proxmox, clustering, and PXE booting reflects detailed knowledge and understanding in the area of virtualization and systems infrastructure. I’ve not only configured a high-availability cluster and managed it using both GUI and CLI, but also implemented PXE booting to automate OS deployments—showing a strong grasp of how modern IT environments are built and maintained. This aligns closely with current industry practices where centralized management, automation, and scalability are essential, especially in hybrid cloud and on-prem solutions. The hands-on skills I’ve developed form a solid foundation for future learning in areas like cloud computing (e.g., AWS, Azure) and Infrastructure-as-Code tools (like Ansible or Terraform). My experience prepares me to transition smoothly into more advanced domains where automation, resilience, and distributed design are key.

At my internship, I’ve been working with Proxmox, setting up a server and configuring it into a clustered environment. This experience directly ties into two key concepts in modern IT: virtualization and clustering. Virtualization allows one physical machine to run multiple isolated virtual machines, each with its own OS and workloads. Clustering, on the other hand, connects multiple nodes to work as one system, providing redundancy, high availability, and scalability. Using Proxmox, I’ve been applying these technologies to build a more efficient and resilient IT infrastructure.

In today's IT landscape, the demand for centralized management, redundancy, and scalable infrastructure is rapidly growing. At my internship, I’ve experienced this firsthand by working on a Proxmox VE cluster, where I use both the web interface and CLI tools to manage and configure nodes efficiently—providing a unified and streamlined approach to infrastructure control. I also configured High Availability (HA), ensuring that in case of a node failure, virtual machines automatically migrate to another node within a minute, minimizing downtime and maintaining service continuity. For scalability, I'm currently developing a PXE boot solution to automate OS installations on new desktop machines, which will significantly speed up deployment and resource scaling. These tasks not only reflect modern IT priorities but also show how practical solutions can make infrastructure more resilient, efficient, and adaptable.

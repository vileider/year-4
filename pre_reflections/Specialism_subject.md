At my internship, I’ve been working with Proxmox, setting up a server and configuring it into a clustered environment. This experience directly ties into two key concepts in modern IT: virtualization and clustering. Virtualization allows one physical machine to run multiple isolated virtual machines, each with its own OS and workloads. Clustering, on the other hand, connects multiple nodes to work as one system, providing redundancy, high availability, and scalability. Using Proxmox, I’ve been applying these technologies to build a more efficient and resilient IT infrastructure.

In today's IT landscape, the demand for centralized management, redundancy, and scalable infrastructure is rapidly growing. At my internship, I’ve experienced this firsthand by working on a Proxmox VE cluster, where I use both the web interface and CLI tools to manage and configure nodes efficiently—providing a unified and streamlined approach to infrastructure control. I also configured High Availability (HA), ensuring that in case of a node failure, virtual machines automatically migrate to another node within a minute, minimizing downtime and maintaining service continuity. For scalability, I'm currently developing a PXE boot solution to automate OS installations on new desktop machines, which will significantly speed up deployment and resource scaling. These tasks not only reflect modern IT priorities but also show how practical solutions can make infrastructure more resilient, efficient, and adaptable.

In my internship, I've been working with Proxmox VE, an open-source virtualization platform that integrates KVM for full virtualization and LXC for containers. It offers a web-based interface for managing virtual machines, containers, storage, and networks, facilitating centralized management of IT resources .
I've configured a Proxmox cluster by connecting multiple nodes, enabling features like high availability and resource sharing. This setup ensures that if one node fails, workloads can be automatically migrated to another, minimizing downtime .
Additionally, I'm implementing PXE booting, which allows computers to boot and install operating systems over a network without the need for physical media. This approach streamlines the deployment of operating systems across multiple machines, enhancing scalability and reducing manual intervention .

I installed Proxmox VE by first creating a bootable USB from the ISO and then booting the server to launch the graphical installer. The setup process involved selecting the target disk, configuring the network with a static IP, and setting the root password. After installation, I accessed the Proxmox web interface via the server's IP address on port 8006, allowing me to manage virtual machines and containers. I also utilized the command-line interface on each node for quicker configurations when necessary

I set up a Proxmox cluster where multiple nodes communicate over a private network to synchronize configurations and monitor each other's status. This setup enables high availability; if one node fails, its virtual machines automatically migrate to another node, ensuring minimal downtime. To facilitate this, I configured shared storage using NFS, allowing all nodes to access the same disk images and data. This shared storage is crucial for seamless VM migration and consistent data access across the cluster.

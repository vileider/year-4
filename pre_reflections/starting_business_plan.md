LO4.10.1.2
MVP - Software challenge
Create a business plan for a product, including a cashflow forecast.
Create a business plan.  This should encompass LO4.10.2.2 which is the market research report for the chosen industry area. This should not be a stale document, but one that you have researched carefully based on case studies you find.  Try and compile as much real data for this as possible.  Sources such as Gartner magic quadrant and other similar research can help evidence a market.  Cashflow forecast example can be found all over the web.  We would especially recommend looking at sites dedicates to pitchdecks and startup pitches for a way to present this document.

You will need to work on this in parallel to the first iteration, this is normal for a startup product.

The market for RPG farming tycoons has competitors but is not entirely oversaturated, especially when it comes to combining deep tycoon mechanics with RPG elements. To stand out, Our team  should focus on innovative gameplay by deepening the tycoon aspects (e.g., market management, production chains) and offering new settings (e.g., futuristic or magical worlds). We can consider implementing unique multiplayer modes with competitive or cooperative farming tycoon gameplay in next game itteration.

Review common pitfalls and mitigations in common quality assurance techniques.
You will need a plan to make sure your product is of high enough quality.  When you have a plan you can then review it for pitfalls and mitigations (see Year 3 Risks and Issues).  Make sure you name the quality assurance techniques.  You can refer to more detail from your notes from previous years to save time and limit repetition.



I spoke to my old friend, and we discussed the opportunity of creating a smart home assistant device. We decided to meet the next day, but while I have a learning outcome to complete, I can use that idea/project as an example of "reviewing common pitfalls and mitigations."

At first, I should refer to the quality standards mentioned in the reflection I wrote that might be used in the "Smart Meter Project" I am about to start tomorrow. During the initial meeting, I already mentioned the need for a code of conduct and project specification to create an agreement between us on what needs to be done, how it should be done, and expectations from each other.

To ensure our smart home assistant device and its app are high-quality, we need a good quality assurance (QA) plan that spots common issues and how to fix them. We'll use QA techniques like test automation, performance testing, and requirements engineering support.

A common problem with test automation is depending too much on automated tests and not doing enough manual testing. This can cause us to miss details that affect the user experience. To prevent this, we'll also do exploratory testing, where testers use the app in various ways to find issues the automated tests might overlook.

In performance testing, if we don't accurately mimic real-world conditions, we might miss problems with how the app handles lots of users or data. To fix this, we'll create performance tests that reflect how people actually use the app and consider different network conditions.

For requirements engineering, unclear or constantly changing requirements can happen if we don't communicate well with everyone involved. To avoid this, we'll set up clear communication channels and have regular reviews of the requirements, as we learned in our Year 3 Risks and Issues notes.

By identifying these common pitfalls and planning how to handle them, our QA plan will improve the software's quality and make sure our customers are satisfied.

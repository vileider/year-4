Here's the corrected version with improved spelling and grammar:

What I have found is that IBM services are very powerful and highly diverse tools. Basically, anyone who does something in IT can find something for themselves.

I had two issues with the IBM cloud:
1. I have found that the IBM UI is not user-friendly.
   - Maybe ASD students could prepare something better in the form of some sort of collaboration.
2. The tutorials that are available online are obsolete.
   - Whenever I have been setting up the pipeline, using databases, or establishing servers, I missed having video tutorials or more easily accessible documentation.

I know that it is hard to. fix everything at once.

Technical
LO4.11.1.5
Long tail of the software lifecycle
Profile the performance of existing code and be able to refactor where appropriate, considering improvements to efficiency, scalability, maintainability and extensibility.
Again what it says.  The existing code could be your own code (least preferable), some open source code, a peer's code that you are reviewing for your project (best).  If you are doing regular code reviews this should be easy to fit into your main project.  You should think how you are going to test performance and what performance means in the context of your product - it's not always obvious.  You should back these thoughts up with academic and/or industry literature.

Technical
LO4.10.3.5
Release - Software challenge
Compose a software configuration and release pipeline that complies with industry best practices.
What it says on the tin.  You need a standard pipeline to enable your iterative development.


Hi Vishnu.

What are some best practices for optimizing data flow performance in large-scale systems? I'm particularly interested in techniques for reducing latency, improving resource utilization, and maintaining reliability in data pipelines.

# Data set increases. Vishnu uses same analysis techniques but in a bigger scale. He uses pandas and optimized SQL queries
- data pipelines
- expertise on small data sets help to understand it when scaling it up
- Google data analytics
- AI co-pilots help to tackle problems while doing it
- data engineering is critical when moving large data
- data visualization helps in catching the big picture or eventual mistakes

2. What are you 
- pipeline depends on tools I use
- depends on documentation and testing
- there should be an element of redundancy
- I need to think about scaling it x 100 in the future
- I should start documenting the process at the first day
- documenting the errors for others that will help a lot
- doing mistakes is good, it will prevent from doing mistakes in the future
